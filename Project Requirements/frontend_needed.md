- We have 2D matrix (9x9), you just need to create 9x9 matrix UI :)
- board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
- Replace "." with empty cell

- Take user input and create 2D matrix and send it using api, first we check if its valid or not and then we solve sudoku and send solved 2D matrix.
